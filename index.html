                <h2><u>What is facebook</u></h2>
                <p>Facebook is a social networking tool that connects people from around the globe together in a matter of milliseconds. Facebook is a website and a mobile application that lets users post a range of media platforms on the platform in the form of text, photos and videos. Other users can then ‘like’ or comment on the post making it interactive from user to user. Facebook’s messenger application lets users instant message each other with little delay which is the main theme that surrounds the issues associated with facebook. Is social interaction between two people becoming obsolete in a face to face contact? And becoming more an interaction over two technological advancements that use Facebook. The application is described by many scholars as an “unsocial network” as it defeats the purpose of social interactions. However as this instant messaging type of social networking is getting quicker and more accessible to billions of people around the globe, talking to one another is looking like a tradition of the past.</p>

                    <h2><u>Narcissism and anti-social behaviour within social media</u></h2>
                    <p>Narcissism means to have <i> “self-absorption, vanity, superiority, and exhibitionistic tendencies”</i> (Carpenter, 2012, pp483). Facebook users can become “addicted” to the social networking that the application provides which has many implications to the real life sociability of the user and how they interact with others outside of social media. Social media but especially Facebook is now the biggest driver of communications between people and communicating local and international news on the market. People become encapsulated into the “hierarchy” of their social media page and how “popular” they are amongst their Facebook friends. This can lead directly to anti – social and “narcissist” behaviour as the user desires attention to themselves. Studies show that the amount of Facebook friends a user has is directly proportional to the amount of anti-social tendencies they will show. (Carpenter, 2012, pp484). The more Facebook friends a person has and how “popular” they are in there social network of friends Carpenter expresses that <i>“They would be more likely to focus on the status updates from their network for the purpose of determining if their network is speaking as well of them as their inflated sense of self-importance would demand.” </i>(Carpenter, 2012, pp485). Thus showing how users can become a detriment to society through showing these anti-social behaviours because of the lack of social skills in the real world. </p>

                    <h2>Cyber-Bullying</h2>
                    <p>Cyber-Bullying incorporates both the outside world and the virtual world together through social media that ridicules, discriminates, makes up rumours or puts down a user/person. This has become one of the biggest issues surrounding social media. With cyber bullying a bully or group can cause mental harm to another person over Facebook by making statuses or making comments that debilitate them. Cyber- Bullying can happen 24/7 as the internet/social media is easily accessible and is used by most people every day. A peer reviewed article by InformationWeek shows a girl who sued Facebook as a company because of the cyber-bullying that was caused onto her. <i>“Denise Finkel claims that her former classmates at Oceanside High School created a Facebook chat group to ostracize, ridicule, and disgrace her”</i>( InformationWeek, 2009,pp1). Cyber- Bullying occurs in every social media outlet however it is most apparent within Facebook because of its ability of instant messaging and comment features. Cyber-Bullying is now illegal in several countries including Australia where penalties are harsh for those convicted. Fines, Community service and even jail time can be a punishment of those who bully people or several people online. Cyber-Bullying can diminish a persons self esteem as seen within the article <i>“Finkel's lawyer said that the student had a very difficult time in high school and that the four classmates made sure she felt unwanted there.”</i> (InformationWeek, 2009,pp1). </p>
